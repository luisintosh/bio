    <p class="text-2xl text-pretty">
      I&apos;m a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>, based in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, with a
      decade of experience designing and delivering reliable, user-friendly applications.
      <br /><br />
      My focus is <strong>frontend development</strong> with Angular, React, and Vue, but I work
      comfortably across the stack, from <strong>backend APIs</strong> in Node.js to automated CI/CD
      pipelines in GitLab, and cloud deployments on <strong>AWS and GCP</strong>. <br /><br />
      Always exploring how GenAI can <strong>accelerate</strong> development and improve software
      workflows.
